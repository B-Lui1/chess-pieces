            <h2 id="orange">The Pawn</h2>
            <p><b>The Pawn</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability to work with other pawns and to become promoted. 
                Pawn chains can be very powerful and a pawn can be promoted to another piece if it reaches the other side of the chess board.</p>

            <h2 id="blue">The Knight</h2>
            <p>The Knight is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its unique L-shaped movement and ability to jump over other pieces. 
                It is impossible to block a Knight.</p>

            <h2 id="red">The Queen</h2>
            <p>The Queen is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its power.  The Queen can move any number of spaces in any direction!</p>
